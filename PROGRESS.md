  -  Used **TailwindCSS** to style the entire dashboard UI.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Challenges

1. **Page Navigation System:**
   - Currently uses local `useState` to switch between components instead of dynamic routing.
   - Not an issue for static dashboards, but may need routing (`react-router-dom`) for deep linking or external page access.

2. **Documents Section Features:**
   - Implementing:
     - Search by name/keyword
     - Sort by latest/oldest
     - Category tabs (All, Lab Results, Imaging, Prescriptions, etc.)
   - Designing cards with:
     - Document name, type (PDF, DOCX), patient name & avatar
     - Timestamps and buttons (View, Download, Ask AI)
   - Ensuring **animations on hover and card expansion** using Tailwind utilities

3. **Responsiveness & Interactions:**
   - Managing card responsiveness across mobile/tablet/desktop
   - Adding smooth hover, tap, and transition effects

4. **Deployment & Visibility:**
   - Preparing the project for public deployment
   - Ensuring the GitHub repo is up-to-date with regular commits

1. **Build Document Card Functionality:**
   - Use dummy JSON array to simulate document entries

   - Floating action button (FAB) for quick upload or scroll-to-top

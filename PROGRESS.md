## ‚úÖ Completed Work

- **Custom Setup Using Vite + TailwindCSS:**
  - **Created a fresh project** using **Vite** for faster dev experience instead of CRA
  -  Used **TailwindCSS** to style the entire dashboard UI.
  - Translated Material UI and Hero UI layout into **fully custom Tailwind components**.
  - Made the PROGRESS.md and README.md
  - Set up the development environment using `npm install` and successfully ran the dashboard locally.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Challenges

1. **Page Navigation System:**
   - Currently uses local `useState` to switch between components instead of dynamic routing.
   - Not an issue for static dashboards, but may need routing (`react-router-dom`) for deep linking or external page access.

2. **Documents Section Features:**
   - Implementing:
     - Search by name/keyword
     - Sort by latest/oldest
     - Category tabs (All, Lab Results, Imaging, Prescriptions, etc.)
   - Designing cards with:
     - Document name, type (PDF, DOCX), patient name & avatar
     - Timestamps and buttons (View, Download, Ask AI)
   - Ensuring **animations on hover and card expansion** using Tailwind utilities

3. **Responsiveness & Interactions:**
   - Managing card responsiveness across mobile/tablet/desktop
   - Adding smooth hover, tap, and transition effects

4. **Deployment & Visibility:**
   - Preparing the project for public deployment
   - Ensuring the GitHub repo is up-to-date with regular commits

## üîú Next Steps

1. **Build Document Card Functionality:**
   - Use dummy JSON array to simulate document entries
   - Implement search, category filtering, and sorting logic
   - Render responsive and animated cards with required data

2. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Add hover animations using `transition`, `scale`, `shadow`, etc.
   - Polish layout spacing, alignment, and mobile breakpoints

3. **Bonus Features:**
   - Modal for ‚ÄúView Document‚Äù
   - Floating action button (FAB) for quick upload or scroll-to-top
   - Theme toggle (Light/Dark)
   - Search keyword highlighting

4. **Final Submission Prep:**
   - Deploy project publicly on Vercel or Netlify
   - Add detailed `README.md` with screenshots and instructions
